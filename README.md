6.7 Final Report (Website)
Description
It’s time for a retrospective (sometimes called a post-mortem). Reflect on and respond to the following questions to better understand your successes and failures.

Note: Your project need not be feature-complete to receive full credit. We like to see students taking calculated risks on projects, which can still result in failure - or what we call productive failure. Taking risks and failing is an excellent way to learn, so we’d like to reward that.

Review your IoT Venture Pitch assignment. Identify what changed throughout the project, including:
Target Market & Demographics
Security, Hardware, & Software Requirements
Product Function & Components
Power & Cost Budgeting
What parts of your project would you consider a success? Why?
What parts of your project didn’t go well? Why?
If you had to do it again, how might you change your development approach given the finite time and money resources?
Would you change your system design after this development cycle? For example:
Was your wireless communication protocol the correct choice?
Would other sensors or actuators work better?
Did your target market want something different?

In addition to these questions, include evidence of your product working.
Images of your MVP device
Remember, we have a light box in the Detkin Lab for taking nicer photos with good lighting.
You might not want a sterile environment for these photos - consider taking the photos where your device would be operating!
A video demonstrating:
Your Core Product Function
Memfault integration features
Anything else you think is relevant to the project
Imagine you’d like to show your family or a potential employer what you did this semester. What would you want to include?

Answer these questions in your README. Then, using GitHub Pages, make this repository a publicly viewable website. Feel free to create a more beautiful webpage, but the baseline is a webpage generated from the README.md file.

## 1. The Idea
Original idea briefly and sharp pivot
The original idea for the IoT Venture was to create a smart dog feeder. Significant research was put into this and can be referenceed here. However, it was decided to pivot to a more ambitious project and due to some interesting use cases of RTK-GPS for aerial robots, a decision was made to research applications for ground robots instead. Leveraging similar technology, there is a uniqe advantage to accurately knowing the location of a ground robot for using a tool, end effector, or actuator in the real world.
